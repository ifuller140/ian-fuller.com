This research paper discusses the advancemnet of an areial aquatic drone that contains a manipulator for a multitude of use cases. I was fortunate enough to join Dr. Yantian Zha's lab and be able to aid in this paper. I am currently working on the upcoming paper that will follow up with the development of this proposed theoretical multi-domain drone with a manipulator. I am happy to share the drone is well under development and is already flying with multiple successful prototypes and iterations. I am curently the second author of this new paper that my lab is working on.
