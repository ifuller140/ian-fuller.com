## Research Overview

The **Omni-domain AI and Robotics Lab (OAR)** at the University of Maryland, led by [Dr. Yantian Zha](https://yantianzha.github.io/), focuses on bridging the sim-to-real gap in robotics. This is the challenge of transferring behaviors learned in simulation to physical robots. My current research specifically addresses this problem for underwater high-fidelity simulations.

This work directly supports the [Aerial-Aquatic Manipulator project](/project/aam) by creating realistic simulations that allow us to test and validate our drone's manipulation capabilities in virtual environments before expensive and time-consuming real-world trials.

## Technologies & Tools

**Programming**: Python, C++, CUDA  
**Deep Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow  
**Simulation**: NVIDIA Isaac Sim  
**Version Control**: Git, Docker
